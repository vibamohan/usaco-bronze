Oh no, Bessie received a speeding ticket again! This time, Farmer John is determined to teach her a lesson.

Farmer John has arranged N (1 <= N <= 100) farm tasks for Bessie to do over the weekend (no more partying for her). Bessie starts doing tasks at time 0. Each task will take her exactly B_i (1 <= B_i <= 100) minutes to complete. Bessie must complete each task in order, with no breaks in between. She now wonders which task she will be performing at time T_i. Help her answer Q (1 <= Q <= 1,000) questions in this form.

INPUT FORMAT

Line 1: The first line contains integers N and Q. 
Line 2...N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer B_i
Line N+2â€¦N+Q+1: Line N+i+1 contains a single integer  T_i
OUTPUT FORMAT

* Line 1...Q: Line i contains a single integer representing the task Bessie will be performing at time T_i.
